This week had a lot of different parts much like molding itself. 

## Picking a model

To begin, I needed to find something to mold. As usual, I browsed through some past HTMAA students' projects and came up with a short list:
- 2-part heart
- Mug with Kpop person in it
- Squishy mug
- Multiple color sword
- Carcasonne tiles
- Hypercube
- Appa
- Chocolates

### Food safe molding

I'm invovled with the MIT chocolate club so I first decided that I'd like to make molds that we could cast chocolate into. This idea didn't last long however. I talked to Anthony about this during our mold training and he unfortunally advised against this. There's a lot of things to be worried about with food safe molding:
- You need a [food safe silcion](https://www.smooth-on.com/applications/food-applications/)
- Everything that touchs your mold during machining must be food safe
  - You can't use coolant on your endmill

Specificaly Anthony was concerned about doing anything food safe in EDS since it's filled with lead! Now this isn't to say food safe isn't possible. To begin lots of HTMMA students have done it in the past:
- [Making chocolate tree coins](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/sarah_edris/week-06.html)
- [Warewolf chocolates](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.19/EECS/people/jmoralejo/Week-08-MoldingCasting.html)
    - Not sure about the safety of this one since they first cast plaster and then chocolate on top of that
- [Chocolate cats](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.11/people/janice.wang/MAS863.11Site/MoldingCats.html)

However, you need to be worried about the residual material left behind after anything contacts with your mold. I definetely still want to do some chocolate molds in the future, I'll likely just need to better research how to do it safely.

Some other useful links about food safe making:
- [Food safe 3D printing](https://formlabs.com/blog/guide-to-food-safe-3d-printing/)
- [Custom chocolate molds with 3D pritning and vaccum forming](https://formlabs.com/blog/custom-chocolate-molds-3d-printing-vacuum-forming/)

### Appa

My next idea was to try mold Appa from Avatar the last airbender

<Image src={appa} alt="Appa" />

Honestly, I should of spent a couple of seconds thinking about how in the world this could be machined before starting but I got obsessed with the CAD so here's the story. To begin I designed a very rough base in Fusion that somewhat resembled what Appa's body should look like.

<Image src={appaRough} alt="Rough Appa body" />

Then I exported this as an STL and imported it into [SculptGL](https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/) a webbased sculpting tool. It's effectively a simplified version of Blender running in the browser. I was cutting it a little close on time (this was Monday) so decided I didn't want battle Blender and SculptGL looked easier to pick up. 

<Image src={appaRoughInSculptGL} alt="Rough Appa body imported into sculptgl" />

The learning curve was really small and it had all the features I needed to make Appa (except autosaving which is why I have no pictures of the tool itself)). There were a couple of gotchas' throghout which you look out for when using the tool:

- When importing my model I needed to to check **scale and center** under import to keep the dimensions the same as my Fusion file 
- You can change the **Texture** in the right sidebar. I changed mine to **skin** to do a detailed smooth but then forgot about and spent a while being frustated about why everything was having such small effects before switching texture back to **None** and everything worked again.

To turn my rough body into Appa I just played around with all the different tools until I had something I liked

- I **moved** points out of Appa's head to make the horns
- I **inflated** Appa's checks
- I **inflated** Appa's eyes and deflated around them to make the eye sockets
- Used the **brush** to make Appa's distinctive arrow
- **Inflated** and **smooth** Appa's tail to make it more realistic and integrate it with his body
- Some other things

Until eventually I had this:

</div>

### Hypercube

In class on Wednesday Neil showed us a [previous student](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/matted/weekly-projects/6-molding-and-casting.html) who molded a hypercube which is a 4D dimensional cube represented in 3D by having a cube inside of another cube. However this wasn't the first time I had seen this mold. After HTMAA, I assume, that student had made a 3D printed version of their cube mold since in **The Deep** we have the mold and some casted cubes. I run silicion mold training every week, and it's the model people are most interested in especially the squishy version which works as a great stress toy. Unfortunally, the 3D printed mold is netoriously hard to get a good cube out of so I decided to try make my own hypercube I could use for my trainings.

To begin I designed the two cubes in Fusion being careful to use parameters for the sizes and thickness to make it easy to change in the future. 

<Image src={cubeInCube} alt="Cube inside another cube" />

Next I drew a line connecting the bottom corner to a top corner and created a pipe with a rectangular cross section.

<Image src={cubeArm} alt="Cube with an arm" />

Then I circulated patterned and mirrored with arm to make 8 of them in total and get the finished cube

<Image src={cubeFinished} alt="Finished cube" />

Of course, to mold the cube I actually need the negative of the space being taken up by my hypercube. I needed 6 parts â€“ one for each face. I created a cube that was 10mm larger in width than mine and placed my hypercube inside. Then I used the **Combine** feature in Fusion to cut out my Hypercube from the block.

<Image src={cubeWithHyperCubeCutOut} alt="Cube with hypercube cut out"/>

Then I created 4 planes each at a 45 degree angle cutting through the block to divide the block into 6 different pieces

<Image src={cubeWithPlanes} alt="Cube with 4 planes" />

Which gave me the piece I needed to mold

<Image src={cubeNegative} alt="Negative of cube to mold"/>

## Doing the CAM 

Once my modal was done it was time to do the CAM. EDS was unfortunally not open when I did this so I had to follow the Anthony's [online guide](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.22/site/-/blob/master/doc/CAM/ToolpathPlanning.md/) and [recitation video](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/760338905)

I created a new Fusion file where I made a **1.5"x3"x7"** block of wax. Then I inserted my hypercube negative and cut it out of the block.

<Image src={waxWithCubeCutout} alt="Wax with cube cutout" />

Then I switched to the manufacturing view and created a setup file. Anthony had faced a piece of wood and placed it in the center of the router in EDS which meant I had to set my zero location at the bottom left of the block.

<Image src={waxBlockCamSetup} alt="Creating setup file" />

Anthony recommended using an **adaptive clearing** and then a **flat facing** before switching to the contour finishing operation.

<Image src={adapativeCam} alt="Adaptive clearing operation" />

I had initally followed the RPM and IPM settings Anthony had recommended in his guide however Anthony changed these due to the specifics of the machined

## Cutting the block

In EDS Anthony quickly ran through my CAM, made a couple of changes and then we set it up on the router. Anthony had placed three **dogbones** on a wooden board in the center of the router which we used to set x=0, and y=0. To level the z-axis we connected a placed a metal box on the wood which was electrically connected to the endmill and the router went down until contact was made.

<Image src={waxBlockDogBones} alt="Block placed on dogbones" />

Then we set the **feedrate** to 50% and started the job. Once we were sure everything was going ok, we increased the feedrate up to 100%.

<Image src={camController} alt="CAM control software" />

Then I just had to wait for the job to complete

<Image src={routerCutting} alt="Router cutting the wax block" />

## Molding the block

Since this was a 6-part mold I was pretty worried about getting it all done in time. Oomoo has a **cure time** of around 2 hours and my block only let's me mold 2 at a go so it would of taken a minimum of 6 hours just to make the mold to cast the cube in. Instead I went over to **The Deep** where we have **Mold Star** which has a cure time of only **30 minute**.

Firsly to figure out the volume of material I needed for my mold I placed some Cous Cous into the block.

<Image src={waxBlockWithCousCous} alt="Using CousCous to measure volume of wax mold" />

Then I got my **Part A** and **Part B** of MoldStar and mixed them together. Unfortunally, Mold Star has a **pot time** of **6 minutes** so I wasn't able to take any photos! After 30 minutes, I took out the mold and it was a success.

<Image src={twoMoldedCubeSides} alt="Two molded cube sides" />

I repeated this process 2 more times to get my 6 pieces

<Image src={sixMoldedCubeSides} alt="Two molded cube sides" />

## Casting the cube

With my 6 pieces I could now, **finally**, mold my hypercube. I first applied **mold release** to all my pieces and then used elastic bands to form a cube shape.

<Image src={assembledMoldedCube} alt="Assembled molded cube" />

Then I got Part A and Part B of **Dragon Skin**, another Silicion, and mixed these together with some blue dye and glitter for effect. I then degassed this mixture in a vaccum chamber.

<Image src={castingMaterial} alt="Casting material beside cube" />

Finally, I poured this mixture into my mold. I don't think I did this right as it was getting late and I was pretty tired but I've not gone and checked it yet. 

## Some extra molding

Like I said above I run a mold making training for The Deep. This monday I decied to try experiment with some more molds
