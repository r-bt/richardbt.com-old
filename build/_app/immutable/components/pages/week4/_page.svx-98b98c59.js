Once the S5 is back I\u2019ll be printing ship again."),B.forEach(t),j=f(l),L(D.$$.fragment,l)},m(l,I){a(l,o,I),i(o,E),a(l,y,I),C(b,l,I),a(l,r,I),a(l,g,I),i(g,v),a(l,S,I),C(n,l,I),a(l,u,I),a(l,h,I),i(h,T),a(l,j,I),C(D,l,I),A=!0},p:Ie,i(l){A||(H(b.$$.fragment,l),H(n.$$.fragment,l),H(D.$$.fragment,l),A=!0)},o(l){W(b.$$.fragment,l),W(n.$$.fragment,l),W(D.$$.fragment,l),A=!1},d(l){l&&t(o),l&&t(y),q(b,l),l&&t(r),l&&t(g),l&&t(S),q(n,l),l&&t(u),l&&t(h),l&&t(j),q(D,l)}}}function dt(K){let o,E,y,b,r,g,v,S;return o=new ve({props:{title:"Brainstorming",$$slots:{default:[ft]},$$scope:{ctx:K}}}),y=new ve({props:{title:"3D scanning",$$slots:{default:[mt]},$$scope:{ctx:K}}}),r=new ve({props:{title:"Cadding the ship in a bottle",$$slots:{default:[ht]},$$scope:{ctx:K}}}),v=new ve({props:{title:"3D Printing",$$slots:{default:[ut]},$$scope:{ctx:K}}}),{c(){U(o.$$.fragment),E=p(),U(y.$$.fragment),b=p(),U(r.$$.fragment),g=p(),U(v.$$.fragment)},l(n){L(o.$$.fragment,n),E=f(n),L(y.$$.fragment,n),b=f(n),L(r.$$.fragment,n),g=f(n),L(v.$$.fragment,n)},m(n,u){C(o,n,u),a(n,E,u),C(y,n,u),a(n,b,u),C(r,n,u),a(n,g,u),C(v,n,u),S=!0},p(n,u){const h={};u&2&&(h.$$scope={dirty:u,ctx:n}),o.$set(h);const T={};u&2&&(T.$$scope={dirty:u,ctx:n}),y.$set(T);const j={};u&2&&(j.$$scope={dirty:u,ctx:n}),r.$set(j);const D={};u&2&&(D.$$scope={dirty:u,ctx:n}),v.$set(D)},i(n){S||(H(o.$$.fragment,n),H(y.$$.fragment,n),H(r.$$.fragment,n),H(v.$$.fragment,n),S=!0)},o(n){W(o.$$.fragment,n),W(y.$$.fragment,n),W(r.$$.fragment,n),W(v.$$.fragment,n),S=!1},d(n){q(o,n),n&&t(E),q(y,n),n&&t(b),q(r,n),n&&t(g),q(v,n)}}}function ct(K){let o,E;const y=[K[0],ze];let b={$$slots:{default:[dt]},$$scope:{ctx:K}};for(let r=0;r<y.length;r+=1)b=Ee(b,y[r]);return o=new Qe({props:b}),{c(){U(o.$$.fragment)},l(r){L(o.$$.fragment,r)},m(r,g){C(o,r,g),E=!0},p(r,[g]){const v=g&1?Ve(y,[g&1&&Oe(r[0]),g&0&&Oe(ze)]):{};g&2&&(v.$$scope={dirty:g,ctx:r}),o.$set(v)},i(r){E||(H(o.$$.fragment,r),E=!0)},o(r){W(o.$$.fragment,r),E=!1},d(r){q(o,r)}}}const ze={title:"04 | 3D Printing and scanning",layout:"week"};function $t(K,o,E){return K.$$set=y=>{E(0,o=Ee(Ee({},o),Fe(y)))},o=Fe(o),[o]}class gt extends Me{constructor(o){super(),Ne(this,o,$t,ct,Ge,{})}}export{gt as default,ze as metadata};
